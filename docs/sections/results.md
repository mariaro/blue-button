####Notes
- TypeCode "Cluster" vs. "Battery" seems extraneous.
- LOINC, SNOMED or CPT-4 acceptable coding systems.
- If not an accepted code set, should be set in the translation component.
- Results come in a sub-array; should be inverted so actual result is first class object.
- Inversion means you must loop sub element for each result section, append parent.
- Results may come un-encoded, or coded to localized system.
- EffectiveTime may come in as TS or IVL-TS, so it is stored as an array to account for possibly 2 values.
- TODO:  Afsin thinks the second structuredBody/component are optional.  Need to check it out.
- NOT SUPPORTED:  methodCode, targetSiteCode, author.
- Reference Range is poorly designed, but appears to be either in text, or IVL_PQ format, so implementing both.
- Reference Range low is technically the only one required if using IVL_PQ.

####Result_set.result_set

####Result_set.results.status
- 1..1
- //ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/organizer/component/observation/statusCode
- Should be looked up from set 2.16.840.1.113883.11.20.9.39

####Result_set.results.result
- 1..1
- //ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/organizer/component/observation/code/displayName
- Normalization may re-encode this to standard terminology if coded in a common dataset.
- If not present, and not coded, originalText can be taken from below:

####Result_set.results.value
- 1..1
- //ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/organizer/component/observation/value@value
- Reference 2.28 of CDA spec for PQ style.  All I've seen so far.
- Optional, but results are largely worthless without it.

- //ClinicalDocument/component/structuredBody/component/section/entry/organizer/component/observation/value@unit
- Reference 2.28 of CDA spec for PQ style.  All I've seen so far.
